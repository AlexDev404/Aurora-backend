# Aurora Backend - But Better ;) [WIP]

This repo includes the backend code for Aurora, with accounts, parties, XMPP, and more. 

> **Sidenote:** This repo branch is under intensive development, so hasn't been updated yet, and still is very similar to the `base` branch. If you'd like the original branch, please switch over to the base branch and download it from there. Thank you.

NOTE: We'd appreciate if you rehosted and forked Aurora, credit would be appreciated too, thanks!
