# Aurora Backend - But Better ;)

This repo includes the backend code for Aurora, with accounts, parties, XMPP, and more. 

> Sidenote: This repo is still under intensive development, so hasn't been updated yet, and still is very similar to the `base` branch.

NOTE: We'd appreciate if you rehosted and forked Aurora, credit would be appreciated too, thanks!
